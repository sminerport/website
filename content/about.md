Hi, everyone! I initially created this website as a side-project when I had a little bit of free-time between semesters at CSU-Global.

I am a full-time graduate student at CSU-Global, seeking a Master of Science in Data Analytics (MSDA) with an expected graduation date of October 2021.  I began my studies in October of 2019.  I plan to specialize in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

I am in an accelerated masterâ€™s program, meaning each of my courses is 8 weeks long, as opposed to the traditional 16-week courses you might find at a conventional college.  It is like being enrolled in summer school for two short years.  It truly feels like a 2-year long summer vacation (not really!).

I once counted the pages I was supposed to read in a single week, and the number came out to 279 pages.  It has been like that since October of last year, which means for about 7-8 months now.  Because of this, I am not always able to update this site as much as I would like.

Nevertheless, I have learned a lot.  I learned to create this website.  It was created with RStudio, GitHub, Netlify, and Hugo.  I have also learned Tableau, SAS University Edition, SAS Enterprise Miner, Python, the R language, Git, GitHub, Data Warehousing, Predictive Analytics, and much more! For a while, I knew not what to put on this website, before ultimately deciding to make it something like a memoir of my data science studies.

CSU-Global is an entirely online college.  I have taken online courses before, though never from a wholly online school.  It has been a new experience for me.  Luckily, I am doing well and plan to continue this path.

Before this, I was coding in languages like C, C#, C++, Java, SQL, and anything else I might be forgetting.  I have been working professionally as a developer since 2017.  HTML and CSS, however, are not my specialties, which is why this website looks quite minimalistic.  (Then again, without any ads or complex animations, it does render quite quickly)!

I received two certifications from Red Rocks Community College (RRCC) in 2017, a Programming Specialist Certification, and a Computer Science Certification.  My Bachelor of Arts (BA) is from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC), and is in Psychology, though I switched majors many times throughout my undergraduate career.

I genuinely love computer science and believe the field is a much better fit for me than anything else I have previously studied; it truly feels like home!

Other than that, I have what I think you might consider a short attention span and cannot believe I have made this post so long.

Thank you for reading what is here! 

For the future, I plan to migrate my portfolio to this website.  Also, all the words and the decisions that go into combining them are currently made by me.  What I mean is I think there is a way I can allow you to edit this site, where if I have misspelled something, or you think you can contribute in some way better than I can (you probably can!), you would be able to update this site in the future from the comfort of your own home.  Not that I think anyone really wants to do that.

With that said, I appreciate you taking the time to read this.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions, comments, suggestions, concerns, or anything like that! 

With love,


Scott
