Scott is seeking his Master of Science in Data Analytics (MSDA) from CSU-Global.  He is in an online accelerated program.  His expected graduation date is October 2021.  He plans to specialize in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).

He has social media links in the menu bar.  He is bad at using them.

He thinks his site needs a new theme/layout.  He chose the simplest one when he set this up.
