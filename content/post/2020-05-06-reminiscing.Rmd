Three years I lived in this apartment. I've seen a lot of people come and go. I've lived with some people who have come and gone.

They turned the tru-fit into a church. Once tru-fit closed, crossfit became my favorite pastime. We once rowed a whole marathon indoors as a team and our team won somehow! It was something like 2.5 hours in total.  My time estimate is probably way off.  We each rowed a sprint, like 250 meters, and rotated in and out for 2.5 hours! (Did I mention our team won?)

I watched the pool get built. I can't think of anything else interesting that has happened. I've rearranged my apartment furniture a ton of times.

It took me three years to get the light-rail figured out. Once I got it figured out, it turned out to be a very convenient means of transportation.

I've had four different jobs since I've lived here. I started the Master of Science Data Analytics program at CSU-Global while living here.

The apartment staff has been very courteous and helpful all the while!

No one ever tried to jump off the balcony into the pool, including myself.

Nevertheless, here's a pic of the pool and the skyline, in case you are interested!
