<p>Three years I lived in this apartment. I’ve seen a lot of people come and go. I’ve lived with some people who have come and gone.</p>
<p>I saw the tru-fit down the road morph into a church. It was the best, uncrowded place to workout. Once tru-fit closed, crossfit became my favorite pastime.</p>
<p>I once rowed a whole marathon indoors as part of a team and our team won! It was something like 2.5 hours in total. My time estimate is probably way off. We each rowed a sprint, like 250 meters, and rotated in and out for 2.5 hours. (On second thought, it looks like it was closer to 3 or 4 hours…Did I mention our team won?)</p>
<p>I’ve had five different jobs since I’ve lived here. Never took any vacations. I started the Master of Science Data Analytics program at CSU-Global while living here.</p>
<p>The apartment staff has been very courteous all the while!</p>
<p>No one ever tried to jump off the balcony into the pool, including myself.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, here’s a pic of the pool and the skyline, in case you are interested!</p>

<p>And what can I say? I’m glad my lease is up! Much love! 💗</p>
