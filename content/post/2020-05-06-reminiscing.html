<p>Three years I lived in this apartment. Iâ€™ve seen a lot of people come and go. Iâ€™ve lived with some people who have come and gone.</p>
<p>They turned the tru-fit into a church. Once tru-fit closed, crossfit became my favorite pastime. We once rowed a whole marathon indoors as a team and our team won somehow! It was something like 2.5 hours in total. My time estimate is probably way off. We each rowed a sprint, like 250 meters, and rotated in and out for 2.5 hours! (Did I mention our team won?)</p>
<p>I watched the pool get built. I canâ€™t think of anything else interesting that has happened. Iâ€™ve rearranged my apartment furniture a ton of times.</p>
<p>It took me three years to get the light-rail figured out. Once I got it figured out, it turned out to be a very convenient means of transportation.</p>
<p>Iâ€™ve had four different jobs since Iâ€™ve lived here. I started the Master of Science Data Analytics program at CSU-Global while living here.</p>
<p>The apartment staff has been very courteous and helpful all the while!</p>
<p>No one ever tried to jump off the balcony into the pool, including myself.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, hereâ€™s a pic of the pool and the skyline, in case you are interested!</p>
